# Introduction

## AFT: Account Factory for Terraform

Commit Terraform → Get AWS account in 30-60 minutes

That's it.

## The Problem We Had

Creating AWS accounts manually:
- Takes **days or weeks**
- Different setup every time
- No proper tracking
- Doesn't scale at all

---

## AFT Fixed It

- **30-60 minutes** instead of days
- Same setup every time
- Git tracks everything
- Works for 1 or 100 accounts
